# Week 3

- **First Challenge!!!**

## What I have done

- In this week I have dedicated all my effort to complete and solve the first challenge that was proposed to me.

- You can find the statement
[here](../Tasks/ChallengeTasks/Challenge1/Challenge1.md)!

- You can find my solution [here](../Tasks/ChallengeTasks/Challenge1/Challenge1.py)!

## Conclusions

- The first challenge was really cool, I could gather all that I have learned and remembered so far and put it together all in one program.

- The logic to implement the challenge was too basic, so I didn't struggle with any part of the program. Therefore, I tried to fill the program with some interactions with the user to make it more enjoyable.

- Said that, I hope I could present a efficient solution to the challenge!
