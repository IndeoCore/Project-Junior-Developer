# Week 1

Nesse artigo eu irei descrever meu desempenho e o que eu fiz durante a primeira semana do Projeto Desenvolvedor JÃºnior

In this article I will describe my performance and what I have done during the first week of the Project Junior Developer

## First Lesson

- In the first lesson I have learned about the principles of Computer Science and Computer Programming in python. I've learned about variables and how to navigate using command lines.

- It wasn't my first experience as a developer so I've just remembered the principles and practiced, and that is pretty much what I have done in each lesson.

## Second Lesson

- In the second lesson I have learned how to manipulate variables, read and write informations (output and input data). And how to use this data to atribute values to variables.

- I already knew how to do this stuff. But I learned in language C, so it was important for me learning how to do this with python sintax.

## Third Lesson

- In the third lesson I have learnd about conditionals (if/else) and boolean variables that can either be true or false, and how to manipulate the conditionals with this variables to act like I want it to.

- Alike the other lessons, I've just practiced python sintax for conditionals with the conditional logic that I already knew.

## Fourth Lesson

- In the fourth lesson I have learned about the while statement, to start coding with repetition structures. I've used variables as counter to iterate the repetitions.

- The learning process was pretty much the same as in the third lesson because the sintax for repetition structures are simillar to conditionals structure.

## Conclusion

- Briefly, I have already mastered much of the logical thinking I would have to learn to basical coding, so it was pretty easy to me to do all the activities in this four lessons. However, it was pretty useful because I learned python sintax, that it was something I haven't learnt before in my life
