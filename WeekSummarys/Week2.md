# Week 2

Nesse artigo eu irei descrever meu desempenho e o que eu fiz durante a segunda semana do Projeto Desenvolvedor JÃºnior

In this article I will describe my performance and what I have done during the second week of the Project Junior Developer

## Fifth Lesson

- In the fifth lesson I have learned about functions in python, how to define and how to use them.

- Alike the other lessons, I already knew how functions work in C and why they are so important, so I just learned how to define them in python and how to reffer to them in python.

## Sixth Lesson

- In the sixth lesson I learned about debugging in python, I used IDLE to test my programs step by step and learned how the programs actually work. 

## Seventh Lesson

- In the seventh lesson I have learned about nested loops. Nothing new about syntaxis, but I remembered a very efficient way to use loops.

- I already knew this strategy of using nested loops, but it was pretty good to remember how to use it and practicing it in python.

## Eighth Lesson

- In the eighth lesson I have learned about lists in python. Although it is very simmilar to arrays in C, it has differents implementations and functionalities. Probably this lesson was the more revelant for me in terms of learning. It was not too hard, but was the more challenging one. I have acessed [docs.python](https://docs.python.org/3/) a lot of times to learn about the syntax.

## Conclusion

- Briefly, alike the first week, I have only remembered a lot of things I saw in other languages, but with different syntax. I enjoyed a lot learning how lists in python work and I'm feeling more comfortable to code in python each week passed.
